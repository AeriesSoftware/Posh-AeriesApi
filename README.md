# Introduction 
AeriesApi PowerShell Module is meant to simplify integrations utilizing the Aeries Api rather than requiring SQL scripts to be maintained.
This project will also standardize ways to utilize the Aeries Api for any type of integration such as generating CSV extracts.

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Install the module with `Install-Module -Name Posh-AeriesApi`
2.	Dependencies include PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core 7.1.3+
3.	Utilize the module by putting `Import-Module -Name AeriesApi` at the top of the script file(s)
4.	

# Build and Test
This module has been tested on both PowerShell 5.1 as well as PowerShell Core 7.1.3
The build process is practically non-existent, simply import the `AeriesApi.psm1` file with `Import-Module -Name ".\AeriesApi\AeriesApi.psm1"`
